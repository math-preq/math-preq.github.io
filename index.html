<h1>Math-Preq</h1>

<h2>What?</h2>
This project aims to gather all mathematical prerequisities for different STEM topics.

<h2>Why?</h2>
Many people around the globe need or prefer to self-study mathematics, or even STEM topics; in this case, it could be hard for them to pinpoint what exactly do they need to learn, what is really not necessary to learn, in what order should they study the topics, and where to find good resources for them. This project aims to help these people in the sacred journey of learning.

<h2>How?</h2>
<p>We are currently preparing a series of <a href="https://roadmap.sh">roadmaps</a> for every mathematical or math-based subject that our team knows enough about. Below, you may find a list of their links.</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #FDFF00">Yellow boxes</span> are application boxes (e.g., "The Backpropagation Algorithm"). <span style="background-color: #74ADFF">Blue boxes</span> are "theoretical" mathematical topics (e.g., "A vector space is an abelian group under vector..."; this definition requires knowing some basic Group Theory). <span style="background-color: #FDCAD9">Pink boxes</span> are "applicational" versions of the same mathematical topics (e.g., "A vector space is a set of things called vectors which can be added together..."; this definition does not require knowing anything about groups).</p>
